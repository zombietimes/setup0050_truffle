# [setup0050_truffle](https://github.com/zombietimes/setup0050_truffle)
This script file is for setting up the DApps development environment on Ubuntu.  

## Overview
[setup0050_truffle](https://github.com/zombietimes/setup0050_truffle) is one of the script files for setting up the development environment on Ubuntu desktop.  
[setup0050_truffle](https://github.com/zombietimes/setup0050_truffle) is a part of [setup0000_all](https://github.com/zombietimes/setup0000_all).  
The role of [setup0050_truffle](https://github.com/zombietimes/setup0050_truffle) is to set up Truffle framework.  

## Description
Let's set up the DApps development environment on your local computer by using this script file.  
I think that it is worth learning the smart contract development.  
I focus on Ethereum and Loom Network as the DApps.  

### Truffle framework
Truffle framework is the deployment environment of smart contracts.  
We can compile and upload our smart contracts to the blockchains.  
And we can debug the smart contract executed on the blockchain.

### Environment
This script file is for Ubuntu(Linux).  
I recommend that you use VirtualBox + Ubuntu.  

### Sample DApps
I created some sample smart contracts below.  
I hope to be useful to you when you develop DApps.  
- [Hello world : HelloZombies.sol](https://github.com/zombietimes/dapp_helloWorld)
- [ERC20 : Coin20.sol](https://github.com/zombietimes/dapp_erc20)
- [ERC721 : Asset721.sol](https://github.com/zombietimes/dapp_erc721)
- [Multi contract : ImportZombies.sol](https://github.com/zombietimes/dapp_multiContract)
- [Sending Ether](https://github.com/zombietimes/dapp_sendEther)

## Usage
Run the command on Ubuntu console window.  
```sh
# Ubuntu commands.
git clone https://github.com/zombietimes/setup0050_truffle.git
cd setup0050_truffle
sh ./ubuntuCmd_setupTruffle.sh
```
